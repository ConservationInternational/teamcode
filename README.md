teamcode
========

The github repository for TEAM. This will be the high level repository to share code amongst the TEAM team. These should
be functions or scripts that you may feel others will need to use at some point. Make sure these are adequately commented. 
Functions for comments should describe the arguments (in and return) as well as the key objectives.
